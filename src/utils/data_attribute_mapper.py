"""
Given each company would have custom data models for persisting company information and
other data models in their system, this utility aims at creating
a map entry for data attributes to human understandable keywords to be used
in the instruction templates to be created

For example: Model CompanyInfo for company A:

{
    id: 101,
    companyName: "Company A",
}
